TODO APP
  *made using react.js
  *use node.vs and visual code to install modules, npm etc.
  *enables adding todo in the list
  *enables deleting todo in the list
  *enables marking of todo
  *login page redirect using Routes
  *uses axios to fetch data from jsonplaceholder
  *uses bootstrap for design
  
Extra features that I would like to add if I had more time would be personal todo lists per account and a calendar/time system. It would also help to have a search feature.
